login as a admin --> settings --> create repository --> maven2(hosted)--> give name as jio-release -->
select version policy [release] --> scroll down ---> create repository. 


NOTE: For each project we are going to create two types of repositories.

      1. jio-snapshot
      2. jio-release

NOTE: Each repository we have separate URL
  
     http://13.235.244.97:9676/repository/jio-release/
     http://13.235.244.97:9676/repository/jio-snapshot/

How to integrate nexus with maven?
==================================

step 1: connect to maven server, Where java projects are available

step 2: where to keep our repository details?

update the details in pom.xml

          <distributionManagement>

            <repository>
              <id>nexus</id>
              <name>KK FUNDA Releases Nexus Repository</name>
              <url>http://13.235.244.97:9676/repository/jio-release/</url>
            </repository>

            <snapshotRepository>
              <id>nexus</id>
              <name>KK FUNDA Snapshot Nexus Repository </name>
              <url>http://13.235.244.97:9676/repository/jio-snapshot/</url>
            </snapshotRepository>

        </distributionManagement>

step 3: Where we need to keep nexus credentials?

--> In SonarQube we updated credentials in pom.xml
--> In nexus, repo details in pom.xml and credentials in # vi /opt/apache-maven-3.9.8/conf/settings.xml

  129 <server>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>R@venkat12345</password>
    </server>

IQ] How to deploy antifactory into nexus?

step 1: go to project directory , Where the pom.xml is available.

step 2: mvn clean deploy

NOTE: if you execute "mvn clean deploy" multiple times , Each time it will upload war file into "nexus snapshot repository"


====================================================================================================




IQ] why it is always uploading into snapshot repo, why not release repo?

ANS: In pom.xml <version> tag we defined "SNAPSHOT" , If you remove that tag then it will store in the release repo.

add  <version>1.0.0</version>


NOTE: one version, you can create only once, If you are tying to deploy again without changing the version, you will get bad request error (400)

   mvn clean deploy ----> Build will fail.


settings ---> select repo --> policy --> allow redeploy ---> save


again disable the redeploy


  mvn clean deploy
